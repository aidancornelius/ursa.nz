kia ora, werte, welcome to ursa.

ursa is a backronym; the universe as reflected by sarah and aidan. cute, huh? thank you for dropping by, or wanting to be a part of this.

ursa crafts media which disrupts capitalist and colonial normalcy. this takes many forms, from documentary to essays, yarns to sharing kai, app development and podcasts, you name it. when we are able, and it is appropriate, we will make projects, ideas, and works public under copyleft. if you are old school like us, drop a bookmark to this site and pop back every now and then. if you have a project that might fit our motif and want help, please drop us a line, or just say hello either way: [hola@ursa.nz](mailto:hola@ursa.nz)

this project was initially born and raised on the lands and waters of the Kulin
