hi, welcome to ursa.

this is a space where we collect works, think on things, and act relationally.
ursa is a backronym; the universe as reflected by [sarah](https://tuhoro.com)
and [aidan](https://cornelius-bell.com). cute, huh? this is just a landing site
while we work life out. thank you for (wanting to) being a part of this.

this project was initially born and raised on the lands and waters of the Kulin
nation. we aspire to work with respect and gratitude for the custodianship of
Elders past and present, and extend our acknowledgement to custodians of the
many Countries this site may appear upon.

read more on our values at this [microsite](https://manifesto.ursa.nz).
