kia ora, werte, welcome to ursa.

this is a space where we collect works, think on things, and act relationally.
ursa is a backronym; the universe as reflected by sarah
and aidan. cute, huh? this is just a landing site
while we work life out. thank you for dropping by, or wanting to be a part of this.

ursa intends to craft media which disrupts capitalist and colonial normalcy. this may take many forms, from documentary to essays, yarns to sharing kai, and even app development. when we are able, and it is appropriate, we will make projects, ideas, and works public under copyleft. if you are old school like us, drop a bookmark to this site and pop back every now and then. if you have something that might fit with our motif and want help with working on please drop us a line, or just to say hello: [hola@ursa.nz](mailto:hola@ursa.nz)

this project was initially born and raised on the lands and waters of the Kulin
nation. as Indigenous peoples, we aspire to work with respect and gratitude for the custodianship of Elders past and present, and extend our acknowledgement to custodians of the many Countries this site may appear upon. we recognise Māori as Tangata Whenua of Aotearoa. we seek to witness and affirm the sovereignty Indigenous peoples globally.
